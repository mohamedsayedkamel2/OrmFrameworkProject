Actors:
1- User

Preconditions:

Goals (Successful Conculstion):
1- The user data had been inserted into the database

Failed Conclusion:
1- The object is invalid
2- The object does not exist in the database and the user does not want the object to be created in the database if it does not exist

Extensions (Alternatives)
1- The object table does not exist in the database
2- The object does not exists in the database and the user allows inserting the object

1- User sends an object
1A- Object is Invalid
1B- Display an error to the user and halt the execution
2- Object is validated
2A- The object table does not exist in the database
2B- Create a table of that object type in the database
3- Object table existence is validated
3A- The user object does not exist in the database and the user didn't specify the option to make insert a new object in the database in case if the object does not exist
3B- Display an error to the user and halt the execution
3C- The user object does not exist in the database and the user specified the option to insert a new object in the database in case if the object does not exist
